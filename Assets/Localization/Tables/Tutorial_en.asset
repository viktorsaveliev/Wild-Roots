    m_Localized: Hi, now I will teach you how to play. First, approach the grenade
      to pick it up. To move, use the left joystick or the arrows on the keyboard
      (depending on your device)

    m_Localized: Fine! You have a grenade in your hands. Now drop her. For this,
      use the right joystick. Just pull and release when you're ready. Remember,
      the further you pull, the harder you throw =)

    m_Localized: Well done! Now let's try to throw the enemy off the platform (this
      is the main goal of the game). Take a grenade and throw it next to Ivan.

    m_Localized: If the enemy is not outside the platform, and there is no weapon
      at hand, then you can push him with your hands. Get closer to Ivan and use
      the right joystick. The same as with a grenade, you already know how =)
